- make Reader a sep file - done

- for the next part we need:
  - tf ( term freq, per doc, via dictionary):
    LISA:
    Have the following structure:
      Global Dictionary:
        key     value
        "cat"   [<doc id, tf>, <doc id, tf>....]

  - |D| the length of specific document (where should it be saved?)
        - a dictionary? where key = doc id, value |D|

  - avg|D| - the average of the lengths of all the documents
           -  constant, calculate in advance

  - |N| - length of the collection
          - constant, calculate in advance

  - df - the num of docs where this term occurs, length of the list

  - k = 2
    - constant, set in the beginning - done




df dictionary:
when did lines - do tokens, length of the tokens list + id

How to create a Global Dict(GD)?

- go through all docs. If a term is in doc. Is it in GD?
It is. Take the last tuple of the list (cause we do it sequentially)
  Does the id of the doc match current id?
  Yes! - then change tuple <id, tf> => <id, tf+1>
  No - then append a new tuple to the list
no: add a new key with value [(doc id, tf)]
